        <h1>EARLY HISTORY</h1>
        <p>The Leonberger, or Leo, is a giant dog with a hard-working spirit and a gentle disposition that hails from the city in Germany after which it was named. 
            <br/>
            Although the breed almost went extinct in World War I, it was savedâ€”and thankfully so, as the breed is intelligent, noble, and very loyal. 
            <br/>
            Leonbergers make excellent working dogs but are also calm and affectionate companions. 
            Mature males develop a pronounced lion-like mane, adding to their distinguished appearance.</p>
